# My learning-cpp repository

This repository holds my training .cpp files. I created while attending to the course ["C++ Essential Training"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-essential-training-15106801), which is a [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) course by [Bill Weinman](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/bill-weinman/). **I do not hold complete authorship of every line of code in these files, they are just a few results from my training**.
